    <h1 class="title">What is Crypto Currency?</h1>
    <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital form of exchange that uses cryptography to maintain the security of each users currency. Cryptocurrency is peer-to-peer, meaning there are no third parties involved such as banks. Rather than being a physical form of currency, crypto is completely digital and online.</p>
